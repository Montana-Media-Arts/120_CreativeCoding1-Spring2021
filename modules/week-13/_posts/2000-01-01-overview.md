# Week 13 Overview <br />

This week, we will discuss Arrays.  As always, we will discuss what they are, why we use them, and then apply them to our project.

For our discussion, we will talk about disruptive technology in the art world.  What do you think will be the next disruptor?  I look forward to reading your thoughts!
