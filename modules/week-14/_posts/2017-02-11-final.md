# Final Project

For your final project, you are going to create a p5.js project of your own. You have complete autonomy to create something that sounds fun to you. It can be a simple game, a piece of art, visual story, or anything else that sounds fun to you.

Next week, there is **no formal class** so that you can work on this project. However, if you need me, please do not hesitate to contact me!  Your final is due on **April 30, 2021 11:59 PM**.

It was great having you in class and I hope to see you again soon!
