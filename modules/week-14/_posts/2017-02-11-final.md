# Final Project

For your final project, you will create a "Portfolio" of your work. You should take screenshots where appropriate and add a page in your web project that shows all the projects you created. You should write a description under each project image. Don't forget to link to this new portfolio page from your original pages.   

Next week, there will be **no formal class**. However, if you need me, please do not hesitate to contact me!  Your final is due on **Nov 25, 2020 11:59 PM**.

It was great having you in class and I hope to see you again soon!
