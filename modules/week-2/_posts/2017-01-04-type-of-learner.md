<p>This section is all about how do we learn best.  Why do I put this in here now?  I want to us to better understand how optimally learn (which can be different for everyone) and then find the best way to achieve our goals.  When I took this learning quiz, I discovered that I was equally a visual and an auditory learner.  This information about myself is important because it means I learn best by watching and listening to others perform tasks.  Then, I can master things more easily.  How do you best learn?  Let's find out!</p>
