# Homework

This week's homework incorporates JavaScript into your HTML pages. You are going to add some basic form validation on the Contact Us page. Then, you will add a fourth page, which has a simple math game. However, you will need to change it to keep track of how many the player gets correct and wrong. Also, show the user their final percentage. For example, if they get 2/4 correct, they should see that they got 50% of the questions right.

**The Math Game is Extra Credit**
